## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have python and pip installed on your machine.

#### On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```
$ sudo apt-get install python python-pip -y
```
Right after having it installed you'll need to get aws-cli and aws-gen.

```
$ sudo pip install awscli awsgen --upgrade --no-cache-dir
```

#### On Windows

For install python go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

Right after having it installed you'll need to get aws-cli and aws-gen.

```
> pip install awscli awsgen --upgrade --no-cache-dir
```

#### On MacOS (under construction)

Please add instructions here

## Installing

First you need to create an account with aws (please go to [Amazon Website](https://aws.amazon.com/))

Go to the terminal and create a new AWS profile using the following command:

```
$ aws-gen configure \
            --account AWS_ACCOUNT \
            --trust-role-arn TRUSTROLEARN \
            --access-key-id AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
            --secret-access-key AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

##### Parameters:
* __`AWS_ACCOUNT`__: stands for the main name of your project or brand, i.e. __brand-project__ or __littleBanana-tree__. This is important because it will link with your profile later.
* __`TRUSTROLEARN`__: Role you need to create with a Superadmin user allowing you do whatever you need. This role will give the properly permissions to run builds, create/update/delete cloudformation, create new services on AWS, etc.
* __`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`__: stands for the access key you will get once you create a user.
* __`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`__: stands for the secret key you will have once you create your user.

After configuring it, you need to create a profile:

```
$ aws-gen create-profile \
            --account AWS_ACCOUNT \
            --profile AWS_PROFILE \
            --region-name AWS_REGION \
            --output AWS_OUTPUT
```

##### Parameters:
* __`AWS_REGION`__: stands for the region you mostly use on your account, where your infrastructure relies.
* __`AWS_OUTPUT`__: We usually use JSON as output format, but there are other options you can explore.
* __`AWS_PROFILE`__: stands for the profile name you want to use. It is important to keep the things organized, so we would recomend to name it follwing the standard __username__@`AWS_ACCOUNT`, i.e. __aboscatto@brand-project__ or __danielpn@littleBanana-tree__.

## Using

### Generating an authenticaded AWS console link

If you need to access the AWS Console using the `TRUSTROLEARN` role, please do the following:

```
$ aws-gen get-link --account AWS_ACCOUNT --profile AWS_PROFILE
```
##### Parameters:
* __`AWS_ACCOUNT`__: stands for the main name of your project or brand, i.e. __brand-project__ or __littleBanana-tree__. This is important because it will link with your profile later.
* __`AWS_PROFILE`__: stands for the profile name you want to use. It is important to keep the things organized, so we would recomend to name it follwing the standard __username__@`AWS_ACCOUNT`, i.e. __aboscatto@brand-project__ or __danielpn@littleBanana-tree__.


### Generating temporary AWS Access key

If you need to access the AWS using access key over the `TRUSTROLEARN` role, please do the following:

```
$ aws-gen get-key --account AWS_ACCOUNT --profile AWS_PROFILE
```
##### Parameters:
* __`AWS_ACCOUNT`__: stands for the main name of your project or brand, i.e. __brand-project__ or __littleBanana-tree__. This is important because it will link with your profile later.
* __`AWS_PROFILE`__: stands for the profile name you want to use. It is important to keep the things organized, so we would recomend to name it follwing the standard __username__@`AWS_ACCOUNT`, i.e. __aboscatto@brand-project__ or __danielpn@littleBanana-tree__.

##### Output:
* __`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`__: The access key ID that identifies the temporary security credentials.
* __`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`__: The secret access key that can be used to sign requests.
* __`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`__: The token that users must pass to the service API to use the temporary credentials.


### Setting active profile

If you need active profile default, please do the following:

```
$ aws-gen set-active-profile --profile AWS_PROFILE
```
##### Parameters:
* __`AWS_PROFILE`__: stands for the profile name you want to use. It is important to keep the things organized, so we would recomend to name it follwing the standard __username__@`AWS_ACCOUNT`, i.e. __aboscatto@brand-project__ or __danielpn@littleBanana-tree__.

### Getting active profile

If you need get active profile, please do the following:

```
$ aws-gen get-active-profile
```

### Listing profiles

If you need list profiles, please do the following:

```
$ aws-gen list-profiles

### Deploying with Serverless

```
$ aws s3 ls --profile AWS_PROFILE
```

Here is an example of how it should look like during the installing:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python python-pip -y
```
```
$ sudo pip install awscli awsgen --upgrade --no-cache-dir
```
```
$ aws-gen configure \
            --account brand-project \
            --trust-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/AWSTrustUserRole \
            --access-key-id AK***************KQ \
            --secret-access-key Y*********************0*******P*******S
```
```
$ aws-gen create-profile \
            --account brand-project \
            --profile aboscatto@brand-project \
