# awsgen

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mvallim/aws-gen-cli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mvallim/aws-gen-cli.svg?branch=master)

awsgen is the software that manage AWS Security Token Service (STS) and enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users that you authenticate (federated users).
For more detailed information about using this service, go to [Temporary Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have python and pip installed on your machine.

```
$ sudo apt-get install python python-pip -y
```
Right after having it installed you'll need to get aws-cli and aws-gen.

```
$ sudo pip install awscli awsgen --upgrade --no-cache-dir
```

### Installing

First you need to create an account with aws (please go to [Amazon Website](https://aws.amazon.com/))

Go to the terminal and create a new AWS profile using the following command:

```
$ sudo aws-gen configure --account AWS_ACCOUNT --trust-role-arn TRUSTROLEARN --access-key-id AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --secret-access-key AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

##### Parameters:
* __`AWS_ACCOUNT`__: stands for the main name of your project or brand, i.e. __brand-project__ or __littleBanana-tree__. This is important because it will link with your profile later.
* __`TRUSTROLEARN`__: Role you need to create with a Superadmin user allowing you do whatever you need. This role will give the properly permissions to run builds, create/update/delete cloudformation, create new services on AWS, etc.
* __`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`__: stands for the access key you will get once you create a user.
* __`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`__: stands for the secret key you will have once you create your user.

After configuring it, you need to create a profile:

```
$ sudo aws-gen create-profile --account AWS_ACCOUNT --profile AWS_PROFILE --region-name AWS_REGION --output AWS_OUTPUT
```

##### Parameters:
* __`AWS_REGION`__: stands for the region you mostly use on your account, where your infrastructure relies.
* __`AWS_OUTPUT`__: We usually use JSON as output format, but there are other options you can explore.
* __`AWS_PROFILE`__: stands for the profile name you want to use. It is important to keep the things organized, so we would recomend to name it follwing the standard __username__@`AWS_ACCOUNT`, i.e. __aboscatto@brand-project__ or __danielpn@littleBanana-tree__.

## Generating an authenticaded AWS console link

If you need to access the AWS Console using the `TRUSTROLEARN` role, please do the following:

```
aws-gen get-link --account AWS_ACCOUNT --profile AWS_PROFILE
```

## Generating temporary AWS Access key

If you need to access the AWS using access key over the `TRUSTROLEARN` role, please do the following:

```
aws-gen get-key --account AWS_ACCOUNT --profile AWS_PROFILE
```
##### Output:
* __`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`__: The access key ID that identifies the temporary security credentials.
* __`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`__: The secret access key that can be used to sign requests.
* __`AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`__: The token that users must pass to the service API to use the temporary credentials.

## Deploying with Serverless

Doing the deploy with Serverless should be pretty simple and you need to use the --aws-profile parameter

```
sls deploy --aws-profile AWS_PROFILE
```
## Using aws cli

Doing the use with aws cli should be pretty simple and you need to use the --profile parameter

```
aws s3 ls --profile AWS_PROFILE
```

## Step-by-step example

Here is an example of how it should look like during the installing:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python python-pip -y
```
```
$ sudo pip install awscli awsgen --upgrade --no-cache-dir
```
```
$ sudo aws-gen configure --account brand-project --trust-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789123:role/AWSTrustUserRole --access-key-id AK***************KQ --secret-access-key Y*********************0*******P*******S
```
```
$ sudo aws-gen create-profile --account brand-project --profile aboscatto@brand-project --region-name us-west-2 --output json
```
